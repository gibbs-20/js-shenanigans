This is a repo of fun/silly javascript code

to use it:
1. copy the contence of the wanted scripts file,
2. right click on the page you wish to run it on and select inspect, if inspect is not an option you may need to click on a title/ logo to cause it to be desplayed
3. a side-bar will be opened, click on console and paste (ctrl+v) in the code.
4. if it does not paste you should type in "alow pasting" then try again
